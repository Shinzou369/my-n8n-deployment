# n8n v1.0+ Authentication Fix

## The Real Problem
You're running n8n version 1.102.4, which is **after v1.0**. Basic auth was completely removed in n8n v1.0+.

## What Doesn't Work Anymore
- `N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE` (deprecated/removed)
- `N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER` (deprecated/removed) 
- `N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` (deprecated/removed)

## What Actually Works for n8n v1.0+

### Option 1: Disable User Management (Recommended for Testing)
```yaml
- key: N8N_USER_MANAGEMENT_DISABLED
  value: true
```

### Option 2: Enable User Management (Production)
First login requires creating an owner account:
- Password requirements: 8+ characters, 1 number, 1 capital letter
- Requires SMTP for password resets

## Current Fix Applied
Updated render.yaml to use:
```yaml
N8N_USER_MANAGEMENT_DISABLED: true
```

## Next Steps
1. **Deploy updated config** (manual deploy in Render dashboard)
2. **Access n8n directly** - no login screen
3. **Test your workflows**

## Why This Happened
n8n made major security changes in v1.0, removing simple basic auth in favor of proper user management. For development/testing, disabling user management is the quickest solution.
