# N8N Authentication Disabled

## What Changed
Disabled basic authentication on your n8n instance for easier access.

**Configuration Update:**
- `N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE`: Changed from `true` to `false`
- Removed `N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER` and `N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` requirements

## Access After Deployment
- Go to: https://n8n-app-gvq5.onrender.com/
- No username/password required
- Direct access to n8n dashboard

## Security Considerations
**For Development/Testing**: This is fine for testing your ETF automation workflows.

**For Production**: Consider re-enabling authentication once your workflows are ready:
```yaml
- key: N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE
  value: true
- key: N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER  
  value: admin
- key: N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD
  value: your-secure-password
```

## Next Steps
1. **Deploy**: Changes will take effect on next Render deployment
2. **Access**: Go to n8n directly without login
3. **Fix Google OAuth**: Add redirect URI to Google Cloud Console
4. **Fix Telegram**: Switch to HTTP Request + Schedule approach

Your ETF automation platform is ready for testing with full access.
