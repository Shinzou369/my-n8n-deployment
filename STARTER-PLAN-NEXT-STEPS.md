# Next Steps After Upgrading to Starter Plan

## What Starter Plan Fixes
✅ **Always-on service** - No cold starts or sleep mode
✅ **Full webhook support** - Telegram can reach your n8n instance
✅ **Better performance** - Dedicated resources
✅ **Custom domains** - Professional appearance
✅ **SSL certificates** - Secure connections

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Redeploy with Starter Configuration
Push the updated render.yaml:
```bash
git add render.yaml
git commit -m "Upgrade to Starter plan for webhook support"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Update Render Dashboard
- Go to your n8n-app-gvq5 service
- Confirm it shows "Starter" plan
- Manual deploy if needed

### 3. Test Webhook Connectivity
After deployment:
- Go to https://n8n-app-gvq5.onrender.com/
- Open your Telegram workflow
- Try activating the workflow
- Send a test message to your bot

## Expected Results

### Before (Free Tier):
❌ "Failed to resolve host: Name or service not known"
❌ Webhooks blocked or unreliable
❌ Service sleeps after inactivity

### After (Starter Plan):
✅ Telegram webhooks work properly
✅ Real-time message processing
✅ Always-on service availability
✅ Professional-grade reliability

## Business Impact
- **Reliable automation** for your ETF business
- **Real-time client interactions** via Telegram
- **Professional service** with no downtime
- **Scalable foundation** for growth

The webhook issue should resolve completely once the Starter plan deployment is active.
