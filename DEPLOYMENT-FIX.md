# N8N Deployment Fix - Urgent

## The Problem

Your n8n deployment is failing because:
- The Dockerfile is trying to run `CMD ["n8n"]` but the command isn't found
- We need to use the official n8n Docker image directly, not a custom Dockerfile

## The Solution

I've fixed the `render.yaml` file. You need to push this to GitHub:

### What I Changed

```yaml
# OLD (broken):
runtime: docker
dockerfilePath: ./Dockerfile

# NEW (working):
runtime: image
image:
  url: docker.io/n8nio/n8n:1.102.4
```

### Steps to Fix

1. **Push the updated render.yaml to GitHub:**
```bash
git add render.yaml
git commit -m "Fix n8n deployment - use official Docker image"
git push origin main
```

2. **Delete the broken Dockerfile:**
```bash
rm Dockerfile
git add .
git commit -m "Remove unnecessary Dockerfile"
git push origin main
```

3. **Trigger Render redeploy:**
   - Go to your Render dashboard
   - Click on your n8n-app service
   - Click "Manual Deploy" to deploy the latest changes

## What This Fixes

- Uses the official n8nio/n8n:1.102.4 image directly
- No custom Dockerfile needed
- All n8n commands and dependencies included
- Should deploy successfully

## Expected Result

After redeployment:
- n8n service will start properly
- You'll be able to access your n8n instance
- ETF Dashboard can connect to it

Push these changes to GitHub and redeploy on Render to fix the issue!
