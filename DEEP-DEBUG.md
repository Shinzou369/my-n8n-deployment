# Deep Debug - Telegram Webhook Issue

## Theory: The Real Problem
After multiple fixes, the issue persists. This suggests the problem isn't with n8n configuration but with **Telegram's ability to reach ANY webhook URL**.

## Possible Root Causes

### 1. Render Free Tier Limitations
- Free tier services may have webhook restrictions
- Telegram servers might not be able to reach Render free tier endpoints
- Some cloud providers block webhook traffic on free tiers

### 2. Telegram Bot Configuration
- Bot token might be invalid or revoked
- Bot might not have webhook permissions
- Previous webhook registration might be stuck

### 3. Geographic/Network Issues
- Render's Oregon region might be blocked by Telegram
- Network routing issues between Telegram servers and Render

## Debug Steps to Try

### Test 1: Manual Webhook Test
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"url":"https://n8n-app-gvq5.onrender.com/webhook/test"}'
```

### Test 2: Check Current Webhook
```bash
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getWebhookInfo"
```

### Test 3: Alternative Approach
Instead of webhooks, try:
1. Use Telegram polling instead of webhooks
2. Use a different cloud provider (Vercel, Railway, etc.)
3. Use ngrok for local testing first

## Recommendation
Given the persistence of this issue, consider:
1. Testing with a different webhook service (webhook.site) first
2. Using Telegram polling mode instead of webhooks
3. Checking if your Telegram bot token is still valid
4. Testing with a completely different n8n deployment (different provider)

The "Failed to resolve host" error specifically indicates Telegram cannot reach the hostname, which suggests a fundamental connectivity issue rather than configuration.
