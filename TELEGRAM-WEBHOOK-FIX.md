# Telegram Webhook Issue - Diagnosis & Fix

## The Problem
**Error:** "Failed to resolve host: Name or service not known"
**Cause:** Telegram can't reach your n8n instance to deliver webhook messages

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Webhook URL Issue
Your n8n cloud instance at `https://asfga.app.n8n.cloud/` should be publicly accessible, but the webhook URL might be configured incorrectly.

### 2. Common Webhook Problems
- Webhook URL pointing to localhost or internal address
- SSL certificate issues
- Firewall blocking webhook requests
- DNS resolution problems

## Immediate Fixes

### Fix 1: Check Webhook URL
1. Open your Telegram Trigger node
2. Look at the webhook URL - it should be:
   `https://asfga.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/your-webhook-path`
3. Make sure it's NOT pointing to:
   - `localhost`
   - `127.0.0.1` 
   - Any internal IP address

### Fix 2: Test Your N8N URL
Open this URL in your browser:
`https://asfga.app.n8n.cloud/`

If it doesn't load, there's a connectivity issue with your n8n cloud instance.

### Fix 3: Regenerate Webhook
1. Delete the Telegram Trigger node
2. Add a new Telegram Trigger node
3. It will generate a fresh webhook URL
4. Test the workflow again

## Other Nodes That May Have Similar Issues

### High Risk Nodes (External Services)
- **Webhook nodes** - Any webhook-based triggers
- **HTTP Request nodes** - If pointing to external APIs
- **Slack nodes** - Webhook-based integrations
- **Discord nodes** - Webhook notifications
- **Email nodes** - If using external SMTP servers

### Medium Risk Nodes
- **Google services** - May have authentication issues
- **Airtable, Notion** - API connectivity problems
- **Database nodes** - If connecting to external databases

### Low Risk Nodes
- **Code nodes** - Internal processing only
- **Set nodes** - Data manipulation only
- **IF nodes** - Logic nodes without external calls

## How Bad Is This Error?

### Severity: **Medium**
- **Impact:** Prevents webhook-based automations from working
- **Scope:** Only affects nodes that receive external webhooks
- **Business Impact:** Workflows won't trigger from external events

### Not Critical Because:
- Your n8n instance is running fine
- Internal workflows still work
- Only webhook connectivity is affected

## Prevention Strategy
1. Always use your public n8n cloud URL for webhooks
2. Test webhook URLs before deploying workflows
3. Monitor webhook health in n8n logs
4. Have backup triggers (polling instead of webhooks) for critical workflows

## Quick Test
Try this webhook URL in your browser:
`https://asfga.app.n8n.cloud/webhook-test/test`

If you get an n8n response, your instance is reachable and the issue is with the specific webhook configuration.
