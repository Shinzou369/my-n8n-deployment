Okay okay. this is overwhelming, in a good way. So I have a website and this is where the ETF should fall, meaning, that the ETF dashboard we have for now will mostlikely be put or merged on the website, which is here. https://ergovia-ai.com/taskforce, So I need to know your thoughts first and what should I provide to move forward

Excellent strategic thinking! You're absolutely right - integrating your ETF dashboard into your existing website at https://ergovia-ai.com/taskforce makes perfect business sense. This creates a unified platform for your automation services. Let me analyze your current website to understand the integration approach:

It's on Render
Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Best of both)
What I exactly want to happen is for them to fill up the info, and on my Self serve n8n they will have their own personalized workflow there, but they don't have to access my N8N anymore, just give access and the Workflow will work

Perfect! I understand your vision exactly. Let me analyze your GitHub repository and implement the hybrid approach where clients get personalized workflows deployed to your n8n instance without needing direct access.

Created INTEGRATION-PLAN.md
Perfect! I can see your PRISMITY repository structure. It's a Node.js/Express application with HTML/CSS/JS frontend. Now I understand exactly how to integrate your ETF system.

Integration Strategy - Here's My Plan:
Current State Analysis:
Your Repository: Node.js backend with HTML frontend
Current ETF: Standalone Replit application with n8n integration
Goal: Merge ETF into your existing PRISMITY/ergovia-ai.com platform
Integration Steps:

Created MIGRATION-STEPS.md
Perfect! I understand exactly what you want. Let me create the integration files that will seamlessly merge your ETF system into your existing PRISMITY repository.

What I'll Create for You:
Integration code - Ready to copy into your PRISMITY repository
Enhanced onboarding flows - Taskforce-specific client setup
Backend integration - Merge ETF into your existing server.js
Client isolation - Workflows deployed to your n8n without client access
