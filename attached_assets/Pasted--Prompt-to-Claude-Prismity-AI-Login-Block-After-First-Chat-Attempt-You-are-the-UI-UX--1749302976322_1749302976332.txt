You are the UI/UX frontend designer for **Prismity AI**.

The website UI should remain fully visible and usable *at first*. But if a **user is not logged in** and tries to **send a chat prompt**, Prismity must show a full-screen login requirement and **block further use**.

---

### 🎯 What You Must Build (Frontend/UI Only)

1. **Trigger-Based Login Gate (Frontend Only)**

   * Let the user type into the chat normally.
   * But as soon as they click **“Send”**:

     * If `isUserLoggedIn === false`:

       * **Immediately show a full-page login modal**
       * **Do NOT send the message**
       * Block everything in the background

---

### 🖼 Modal UI Design

* **Dark overlay**: Apply `backdrop-filter: blur(...)` + dark semi-transparent layer to background.
* **Centered login box**:

  * Google Login button (use official style)
  * Message: “Sign in to use Prismity AI”
  * Optional: Add “Your first message will be saved after login” (optional)
* **Disable all background interaction**

  * Prevent clicks, keyboard input, or scroll.
  * Use `pointer-events: none` on background, `pointer-events: auto` on modal.

---

### ✅ Implementation Details

* Place `isUserLoggedIn` (boolean) in frontend state.
* When user sends a message:

  ```js
  if (!isUserLoggedIn) {
    showLoginModal(); // darken background, show modal
    return; // prevent message from being submitted
  }
  ```

---

### ✨ Optional Enhancements

* Animate the modal for smooth UX (fade-in, scale-up)
* Store the unsent prompt so it can be submitted *after* login (optional)

---

### 🧪 Final Test Flow (Expected)

1. User opens Prismity AI (not logged in)
2. User types a prompt and clicks “Send”
3. Instead of chatting:

   * A **login modal** appears over the app
   * Background is darkened and disabled
   * Only option: **Sign in with Google**
4. After login, chat resumes and the UI becomes fully available
