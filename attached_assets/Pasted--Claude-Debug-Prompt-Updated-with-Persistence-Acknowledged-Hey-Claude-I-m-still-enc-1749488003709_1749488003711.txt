> Hey Claude, I’m still encountering the same **UI issue** with my GPT chat output. The GPT messages **render correctly at first** — they show the model name, token usage, copy button, and full formatting — but **after about a second**, the UI **snaps into a simplified version**, showing only the message text and a basic copy button.
>
> 🔒 This is **not a GPT logic issue** — it's strictly **UI/DOM/CSS-related**.
>
> ✅ The correct message structure is already being rendered properly for a brief moment, but something in the page (likely JS or CSS) **is overriding or wiping it** right after.
>
> Please go through this checklist **carefully and step-by-step** to identify and fix what’s causing the UI to snap or reset:

### 🛠️ UI Debug Checklist for Claude:

1. **Check if `.innerHTML = ...` is being used on the output container**

   * If `outputBox.innerHTML = ...` is used after rendering, it can **wipe the full GPT message UI**, especially if another function like `renderMessages()` re-runs.
   * Instead, use `appendChild()` or `insertAdjacentHTML()` to **add messages without clearing** the container.

2. **Ensure GPT messages are rendered only once**

   * There should be no re-renders triggered by `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, or MutationObservers that re-insert or rebuild the output after the initial render.

3. **Check if Lucide or other icon libraries are running late**

   * `lucide.createIcons()` should be called immediately after new messages are inserted.
   * If it's delayed or re-run improperly, it may restructure the inner HTML and lose the extra UI.

4. **Inspect CSS transitions or layout classes**

   * Look at `.message`, `.message.gpt`, `.chat-container`, and `.output-box` for any transitions, animations, or flex/grid overrides that could collapse child elements.
   * Check for animations like `animate__fadeIn` or JS-applied transitions that reflow layout.

5. **Check for delayed rendering of previous chat history**

   * If `renderPreviousMessages()` or similar is triggered **after the GPT response is rendered**, it may override the message format or use an outdated rendering template.

6. **Use `console.log()` inside render functions**

   * Add logging inside any functions that update `.output-box` or `.message.gpt` to see **when and how often they run**, and compare the DOM before/after.

7. **Inspect timing of `MutationObserver` on `.hero-content`**

   * It’s possible the same approach (like DOM protection) is being mistakenly applied elsewhere — confirm `.output-box` isn't affected by over-aggressive protection or re-render rules.

> Please review my message rendering logic and styles using this checklist, and help me prevent the full GPT message UI from being stripped or overwritten after it appears.
> I just want the fully formatted response to stay visible as intended — no re-snapping, no overrides.
