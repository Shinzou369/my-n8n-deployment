<header class="taskforce-hero animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">
        <div class="hero-content">
          <h1 class="hero-title">
            Prismity Taskforce
            <button class="info-button" id="taskforce-info-btn" title="Click for more info">

            Down below are your Prismity Taskforce agents — ready to deploy into real businesses.
            Think of it like running your own AI-powered VA agency: you're the boss.
            You find businesses that need help, and you offer them a Taskforce — an AI agent that works 24/7 like a virtual employee.
            Every time a business signs up, you earn $30/month recurring income, as long as they stay subscribed.
