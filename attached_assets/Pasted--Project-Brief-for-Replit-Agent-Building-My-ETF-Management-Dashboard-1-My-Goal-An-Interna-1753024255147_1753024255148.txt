### Project Brief for Replit Agent: Building My ETF Management Dashboard

**1. My Goal: An Internal Backend Office for Ergovia TaskForce (ETF)**

I need you to build an internal management dashboard. This tool will be my "backend office" for running my business. Its primary purpose is to help me manage, customize, and deploy my Ergovia TaskForce (ETF) workflows for my clients efficiently and without errors.

**2. What is Ergovia TaskForce (ETF)?**

ETF is my collection of pre-built, AI-powered n8n workflow templates. Each template, which I call a "Niche Agent," is designed to automate a specific business vertical. For example, I have a "Pet Clinic ETF" template that handles appointment reminders, customer queries, and other common tasks for a veterinary clinic.

**3. The Core Problem I Need to Solve**

Right now, when I get a new client, the process of setting up their workflow is manual. If I sign five different pet clinics, I have to go into n8n and manually duplicate my "Pet Clinic ETF" template five times. Then, for each copy, I have to painstakingly go through the nodes and replace the placeholder information (API keys, business names, email addresses, etc.) with the specific details for each client. This is slow, repetitive, and it's easy to make mistakes.

**4. The Solution: The ETF Management Dashboard**

I envision a simple, secure web application that acts as my central control panel. This dashboard will automate the entire client onboarding and workflow deployment process.

Hereâ€™s the functionality I need:

*   **Workflow Template Library:**
    *   A section in the dashboard where I can see all my master ETF templates (e.g., "Pet Clinic ETF," "Real Estate ETF").

*   **Client Management:**
    *   A simple interface to add and manage my list of clients (e.g., "Dr. Smith's Pet Clinic," "Happy Paws Vet").

*   **The "Deploy Workflow" Feature (The Most Important Part):**
    *   This will be a guided process. I'll start by selecting a **Client** and a **Workflow Template**.
    *   The dashboard will then present me with a clean form containing all the fields that need to be customized for that specific template (e.g., fields for OpenAI API Key, Google Calendar ID, Clinic Name, Support Email, etc.).
    *   After I fill out the form and hit "Deploy," the system will work in the background to:
        1.  Use the n8n API to make a fresh copy of the selected master template.
        2.  Inject all the client-specific data I just entered into the appropriate nodes and credentials of the new workflow.
        3.  Rename the new workflow to something clear (e.g., "[Client Name] - Pet Clinic ETF").
        4.  Activate the newly created workflow in n8n.

**5. Your Task**

Your job is to build this internal dashboard. This involves creating the frontend for me to interact with, the backend to handle the logic, and the crucial integration with the n8n API to automate the workflow duplication and configuration. The end result should be a tool that lets me onboard a new client and deploy their unique, customized workflow in minutes, not hours.
