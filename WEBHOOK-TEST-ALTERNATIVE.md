# Alternative Solution: Use Polling Instead of Webhooks

## The Issue
Telegram webhooks failing consistently suggests a fundamental connectivity issue between Telegram servers and your Render deployment.

## Immediate Solution: Switch to Polling

### In your n8n workflow:
1. **Delete the Telegram Trigger node**
2. **Add a new node: "Telegram Bot" (not Telegram Trigger)**
3. **Configure it for polling mode:**
   - Set polling interval (e.g., every 5 seconds)
   - Use your existing bot token
   - Enable "Poll for new messages"

### Why This Works:
- **Polling:** Your n8n reaches out to Telegram (outbound connection)
- **Webhooks:** Telegram tries to reach your n8n (inbound connection - failing)
- Render free tier may block inbound webhook traffic
- Polling bypasses this limitation

## Configuration Steps

### Telegram Polling Node Settings:
```
Node: Telegram Bot
Operation: Get Updates (polling)
Bot Token: [Your existing token]
Polling Interval: 5 seconds
Filter: Only new messages
```

### Benefits:
- No webhook URL needed
- Works with any hosting provider
- More reliable for free tier deployments
- Same functionality as webhooks

## Test This First
Before troubleshooting webhooks further, try polling mode. If it works, you can continue with your automation business using polling instead of webhooks.

Many production n8n deployments use polling for Telegram because it's more reliable across different hosting environments.
