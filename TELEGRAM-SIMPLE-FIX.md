# Simple Telegram Fix - No Webhook URL Needed!

## You're Right!
In n8n cloud, you normally just:
1. Add Telegram bot token to credentials  
2. The webhook is handled automatically
3. No manual webhook URL configuration needed

## What's Happening
Your workflow JSON shows:
- `"webhookId": "telegram-webhook-id"` 
- `"instanceId": "c537c4661317102fd1c587a7201cad58d718adf4b8bf36bf12448833e642f67d"`

This suggests the workflow was created on or copied from a different n8n instance (possibly during our Render deployment testing).

## Simple Fix

### Option 1: Fresh Telegram Node (Easiest)
1. **Delete the current Telegram Trigger node**
2. **Add a new Telegram Trigger node from scratch**
3. **Select your existing "Telegram account" credentials**
4. **Save and activate the workflow**
5. **N8N will automatically register the webhook with Telegram**

### Option 2: Check Webhook Registration
1. **Go to your Telegram Trigger node settings**
2. **Look for a "Register Webhook" or "Test" button**
3. **Click it to re-register the webhook with Telegram**
4. **This should fix the host resolution issue**

## Why This Happened
- The workflow might have been imported/copied from the Render instance
- The webhook registration got "stuck" pointing to the old instance
- Fresh node creation will use your current n8n cloud instance URL

## Expected Result
After the fix:
- Telegram will send messages to: `https://asfga.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/...`
- No "host resolution" errors
- Your bot will respond to Telegram messages properly

The simplest approach is Option 1 - just recreate the Telegram Trigger node and it should work perfectly with your existing credentials.
