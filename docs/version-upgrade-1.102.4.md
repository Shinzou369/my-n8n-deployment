## Breaking Changes & Important Notes

### 1. **Webhook HTML Responses**
Starting with version 1.103.0 (and stable in 1.102.4), HTML responses from webhooks are automatically wrapped in sandboxed iframes for security:

**Impact:**
- JavaScript accessing top-level window will fail
- Authentication headers not available in iframe
- Relative URLs won't work (use absolute URLs)

**Action Required:**
- Update webhook responses to use absolute URLs
- Embed access tokens in HTML instead of relying on headers
- Test existing webhook implementations

### 2. **Enhanced Authentication**
- Stronger 2FA requirements for Enterprise users
- Better OAuth credential handling
- More secure credential storage

### 3. **Database Compatibility**
- All database configurations remain compatible
- No migration required for existing deployments
- Improved connection pooling and performance

## Compatibility Matrix

| Component | Previous (1.54.0) | Current (1.102.4) | Status |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| PostgreSQL | ✅ Compatible | ✅ Compatible | No changes needed |
| SQLite | ✅ Compatible | ✅ Compatible | No changes needed |
| Docker | ✅ Compatible | ✅ Enhanced | Better security |
| Render Platform | ✅ Compatible | ✅ Compatible | Full compatibility |
| Existing Workflows | ✅ Compatible | ✅ Compatible | No migration needed |
| API Endpoints | ✅ Compatible | ✅ Compatible | Backward compatible |
