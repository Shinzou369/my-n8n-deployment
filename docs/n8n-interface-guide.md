# N8N Interface Guide for Beginners

## What You'll See When You Access Your Deployed N8N

When you deploy n8n on Render and visit your URL (like `https://my-n8n-app.onrender.com`), here's what you'll see:

### 1. Login Screen
- **Username**: `admin` (set by default in our configuration)
- **Password**: Generated automatically by our deployment script (saved securely)
- Clean, simple login interface

### 2. Main Dashboard
Once logged in, you'll see the n8n interface with several key areas:

#### Left Sidebar:
- **Workflows**: Your main automation recipes
- **Credentials**: Stored login info for services (Gmail, Slack, etc.)
- **Executions**: History of your workflow runs
- **Settings**: Configuration options

#### Main Canvas Area:
- **Visual Workflow Builder**: Drag and drop interface where you build automations
- **Node Palette**: On the left, all available integrations and actions
- **Properties Panel**: On the right, configure each step of your workflow

### 3. Building Your First Workflow

#### Step 1: Create a New Workflow
- Click "New Workflow" or the "+" button
- You'll see a blank canvas with one "Start" node

#### Step 2: Add Trigger Nodes
Common triggers you can add:
- **Webhook**: Triggered by external services
- **Schedule**: Run on a timer (every hour, daily, etc.)
- **Manual**: Run manually when you click a button
- **Email**: When you receive an email
- **Form**: When someone submits a form

#### Step 3: Add Action Nodes
Connect actions after your trigger:
- **Send Email**: Via Gmail, Outlook, etc.
- **Post to Slack**: Send messages to channels
- **Database Operations**: Read/write to databases
- **HTTP Request**: Call any API
- **File Operations**: Create, read, modify files
- **Data Transformation**: Filter, sort, format data

### 4. Workflow Organization

#### Folders and Tags
- **Create Folders**: Organize workflows by project or type
  - "Email Automation"
  - "Data Processing"
  - "Social Media"
  - "Business Alerts"

#### Workflow Naming Convention
Use clear, descriptive names:
- ✅ "New Customer Welcome Email Sequence"
- ✅ "Daily Sales Report to Slack"
- ✅ "Invoice Processing Automation"
- ❌ "Workflow 1"
- ❌ "Test"

#### Workflow Status
Each workflow shows:
- **Active/Inactive**: Whether it's currently running
- **Last Execution**: When it last ran
- **Execution Count**: How many times it's run
- **Success Rate**: How often it works correctly

### 5. Real-World Workflow Examples

### 6. Managing Your Workflows

#### Execution History
- See every time your workflows run
- View input and output data
- Debug failed executions
- Monitor performance

#### Testing Workflows
- **Manual Testing**: Click "Execute Workflow" to test
- **Step-by-Step**: Run one node at a time to debug
- **Test Data**: Use sample data to verify logic

#### Credentials Management
Securely store login information for:
- Email accounts (Gmail, Outlook)
- Social platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook)
- Business tools (Slack, Notion, Airtable)
- Cloud services (Google Drive, Dropbox)
- Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)

### 7. Workflow Best Practices

#### Start Simple
1. Begin with 2-3 node workflows
2. Test thoroughly before adding complexity
3. Use manual triggers while learning

#### Error Handling
- Add error handling nodes
- Set up notifications for failures
- Use retry logic for unreliable services

#### Documentation
- Add notes to complex workflows
- Document any custom settings
- Keep a log of changes

### 8. Advanced Features (Once You're Comfortable)

#### Webhook URLs
Each workflow can have a unique webhook URL like:
`https://my-n8n-app.onrender.com/webhook/customer-signup`

#### Sub-workflows
Break complex automations into smaller, reusable pieces

#### Variables and Expressions
Use dynamic data and calculations in your workflows

#### Conditional Logic
Create if/then branches in your automation

### 9. Mobile Access
- n8n interface works on mobile browsers
- Monitor workflow executions on the go
- Get notifications via email or Slack

### 10. Backup and Export
- Export individual workflows as JSON files
- Backup your entire n8n instance
- Import workflows from other n8n instances

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy your n8n instance** using our automated script
2. **Log in** with your generated credentials
3. **Create your first simple workflow** (try a scheduled email)
4. **Explore the node library** to see what's possible
