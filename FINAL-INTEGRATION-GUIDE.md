# ETF Integration Guide for PRISMITY Repository

## What I've Built for You

Complete integration files to merge your ETF system into your existing Ergovia AI website:

### Files Created:
1. **`server-additions.js`** - Backend integration code for your server.js
2. **`taskforce-onboard.html`** - Beautiful client onboarding interface
3. **`taskforce-onboard.js`** - Frontend logic for automation deployment

## Integration Steps

### Step 1: Backend Integration
Add the code from `server-additions.js` to your existing PRISMITY `server.js`:

```bash
# Copy these sections into your server.js:
- N8N API Configuration
- ETF Database Setup  
- ETF Routes
- Helper Functions
```

### Step 2: Frontend Integration
Copy these files to your PRISMITY `public` folder:
```bash
public/taskforce-onboard.html
public/taskforce-onboard.js
```

### Step 3: Update Your Taskforce Page
Modify your existing taskforce cards to link to onboarding:

**Replace "Coming Soon" buttons with:**
```html
<!-- For Dental Office -->
<a href="/taskforce/dental/onboard?type=dental">Get Started</a>

<!-- For Gym -->  
<a href="/taskforce/gym/onboard?type=gym">Get Started</a>

<!-- And so on for each taskforce -->
```

### Step 4: Environment Variables
Add to your Render environment:
```
N8N_BASE_URL=https://n8n-app-gvq5.onrender.com
N8N_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Step 5: Dependencies
Install additional packages in your PRISMITY repository:
```bash
npm install sqlite3 axios crypto
```

## How It Works

### Client Journey:
1. **Client visits ergovia-ai.com/taskforce**
2. **Clicks "Get Started" on Dental Office taskforce**  
3. **Redirected to `/taskforce/dental/onboard?type=dental`**
4. **Completes 4-step setup wizard:**
   - Select taskforce type
   - Enter business information
   - Configure automation details
   - Review and deploy
5. **System automatically:**
   - Creates personalized copy of your n8n workflow
   - Injects client-specific parameters
   - Activates workflow in your n8n instance
   - Saves client/deployment records

### Your Benefits:
- **Seamless Integration** - ETF becomes part of your existing platform
- **Professional Client Experience** - Branded onboarding flow
- **Complete Automation** - Clients get personalized workflows without manual work
- **No N8N Access Needed** - Clients never touch your n8n instance
- **Scalable Business Model** - Automated client onboarding and deployment

## Business Model Enhancement

Each taskforce type becomes a productized automation service:

- **Dental Office Taskforce** - $X/month for appointment automation
- **Gym Taskforce** - $Y/month for membership management  
- **Contractors Taskforce** - $Z/month for job coordination

Clients onboard themselves, get personalized automation, and you earn recurring revenue without manual workflow setup.

## Next Steps

1. **Integrate the code** into your PRISMITY repository
2. **Deploy to Render** with new environment variables
3. **Test the onboarding flow** with a sample client
4. **Update your taskforce page** with "Get Started" buttons
5. **Launch your automated ETF business!**

This creates a complete white-label automation platform where your clients get personalized n8n workflows through a professional, branded experience - all without accessing your n8n instance directly.
