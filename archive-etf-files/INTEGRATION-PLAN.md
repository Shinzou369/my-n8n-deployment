# ETF Integration with Ergovia AI Taskforce

## Current State Analysis
- **Website**: https://ergovia-ai.com/taskforce 
- **Repository**: https://github.com/Shinzou369/PRISMITY
- **Hosting**: Render
- **Current ETF Dashboard**: Running on Replit with n8n integration

## Integration Strategy: Hybrid Approach

### Client Journey Flow
1. **Client visits ergovia-ai.com/taskforce** → Sees taskforce agents
2. **Clicks "Get Started"** on a taskforce → Redirected to personalized onboarding
3. **Completes setup wizard** → Provides business details and automation parameters
4. **Workflow deployed automatically** → Gets personalized n8n workflow without n8n access
5. **Receives access credentials** → Can monitor/configure through your interface

### Technical Implementation

#### Phase 1: Repository Integration
- Clone current ETF dashboard code into your PRISMITY repository
- Add ETF routes and pages to your existing Render deployment
- Maintain your current taskforce marketplace as client-facing

#### Phase 2: Enhanced Onboarding
- Convert each "Coming Soon" button to trigger specific taskforce onboarding
- Create industry-specific onboarding flows (Dental, Gym, Contractors, etc.)
- Map each taskforce to corresponding n8n workflow templates

#### Phase 3: Client Isolation
- Deploy personalized workflows to your n8n instance
- Clients get unique workflow copies with their credentials
- No direct n8n access needed - workflows run automatically
- Optional: Client dashboard to view workflow status/logs

### Key Benefits
- **Seamless Integration**: ETF becomes part of your existing platform
- **Professional Experience**: Clients stay within your branded ecosystem
- **Complete Control**: You manage all workflows centrally
- **Scalable Automation**: Each client gets personalized automation without manual setup

## Next Steps Required

### From Your Repository
1. **Current tech stack details** (React, Node.js, framework?)
2. **Deployment configuration** (how it's set up on Render)
3. **Existing database setup** (if any)

### Implementation Plan
1. **Integrate ETF code** into your repository structure
2. **Add routing** for onboarding flows
3. **Connect to your n8n instance** using existing API integration
4. **Deploy enhanced platform** to your Render account

This creates a complete client automation platform under your ergovia-ai.com brand where clients get personalized workflows without technical complexity.
