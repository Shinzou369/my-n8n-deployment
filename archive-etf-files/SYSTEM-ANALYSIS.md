## Configuration Analysis 

### Render Configuration âœ…
- **Runtime:** Using official Docker image `docker.io/n8nio/n8n:1.102.4`
- **Database:** PostgreSQL configured correctly
- **Network:** 
  - N8N_PROTOCOL=https âœ…
  - N8N_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0 âœ…
  - N8N_PORT=5678 âœ…

### Critical Issue Found ðŸš¨
Looking at render.yaml lines 58-68:

```yaml
- key: WEBHOOK_URL
  fromService:
    type: web
    name: n8n-app
    property: host

- key: N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL
  fromService:
    type: web
    name: n8n-app
    property: host
```

**THE PROBLEM:** The configuration is using `name: n8n-app` but your service is actually named `n8n-app-gvq5`.

This means:
- WEBHOOK_URL is not being set correctly
- N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL is not being set correctly
- n8n doesn't know its own public URL for webhook registration

## Root Cause
When n8n tries to register the Telegram webhook, it's not using the correct public URL because the environment variables are misconfigured.

## The Fix
Update render.yaml to use the correct service name:

```yaml
- key: WEBHOOK_URL
  fromService:
    type: web
    name: n8n-app-gvq5  # <-- Fixed name
    property: host

- key: N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL
  fromService:
    type: web
    name: n8n-app-gvq5  # <-- Fixed name
    property: host
```

This will ensure n8n knows its public URL is https://n8n-app-gvq5.onrender.com/ and can register webhooks correctly.
