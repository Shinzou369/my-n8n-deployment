# Self-Hosted N8N Status Check

## Current Setup
- **Self-hosted N8N:** https://n8n-app-gvq5.onrender.com/
- **ETF Dashboard:** Replit (connecting to self-hosted instance)
- **Issue:** Telegram webhook failing with host resolution error

## Status Check Results
Testing connectivity to your self-hosted n8n instance...

## Possible Issues

### 1. Render Service Not Fully Started
- Service may be in sleep mode (free tier limitation)
- Takes 30-60 seconds to wake up from sleep

### 2. Password Not Set
- N8N requires basic auth password to be configured
- Set in Render Dashboard: Environment > N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD

### 3. Database Connection Issues
- PostgreSQL database may need connection reset

## Next Steps
1. Check if https://n8n-app-gvq5.onrender.com/ loads in browser
2. Set password in Render if not done already
3. Test webhook registration manually
4. Verify Telegram bot token is still valid

## Architecture Clarification
You have:
- Self-hosted N8N on Render (production instance)
- ETF Dashboard on Replit (management interface)
- NO n8n cloud dependency

This is the correct setup for your business model.
