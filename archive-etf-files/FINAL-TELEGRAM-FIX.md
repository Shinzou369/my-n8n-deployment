# Final Telegram Webhook Fix

## âœ… Good News
Your self-hosted n8n at https://n8n-app-gvq5.onrender.com/ is running perfectly:
- Status: 200 OK
- Health: {"status":"ok"}

## The Remaining Issue
Telegram webhook registration is failing because of authentication setup.

## Complete Fix Steps

### 1. Set N8N Password (REQUIRED)
Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/):
1. Click your **n8n-app-gvq5** service
2. Go to **Environment** tab  
3. Find `N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`
4. Set it to a strong password (e.g., "MyN8NPassword123!")
5. Save changes and wait for restart

### 2. Set Encryption Key (REQUIRED)
In the same Environment tab:
1. Find `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
2. Set it to a random 32+ character string
3. Example: "MySecureEncryptionKey123456789ABC"
4. Save changes

### 3. Access Your N8N Instance
1. Go to https://n8n-app-gvq5.onrender.com/
2. Login with:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: (the password you just set)

### 4. Recreate Telegram Workflow
In your self-hosted n8n:
1. Create a new workflow
2. Add Telegram Trigger node
3. Configure with your bot token
4. Save and activate
5. Test - webhooks should work now

## Why This Will Work
- Your n8n instance is healthy and reachable
- Telegram will be able to register webhooks properly
- Authentication is properly configured
- Fresh webhook URLs will be generated

## Expected Webhook URL
After fix: `https://n8n-app-gvq5.onrender.com/webhook/telegram-xxx/webhook`

This should completely resolve the host resolution issue.
