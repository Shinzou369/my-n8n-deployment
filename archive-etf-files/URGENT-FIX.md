# URGENT: Fix N8N Deployment

## The Issue
The deployment is still looking for a Dockerfile that doesn't exist.

## Quick Fix Steps

1. **Replace render.yaml with the fixed version:**
```bash
cp render-fixed.yaml render.yaml
```

2. **Remove any Dockerfile references:**
```bash
rm -f Dockerfile
```

3. **Push to GitHub:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete fix: remove Dockerfile, use official n8n image"
git push origin main
```

4. **Redeploy on Render:**
- Go to Render dashboard
- Click your n8n-app service
- Click "Manual Deploy"

## What This Does
- Uses the official n8n Docker image directly
- No custom Dockerfile needed
- All environment variables properly configured
- Database connection ready

## Expected Result
- N8N will deploy successfully
- You can access your n8n instance
- ETF Dashboard can connect to it

**This should completely fix the deployment issue!**
