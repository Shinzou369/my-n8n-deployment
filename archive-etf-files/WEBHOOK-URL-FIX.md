# Webhook URL Issue - FOUND THE PROBLEM!

## The Issue
Your webhook URL shows: `n8n-app-gvq5/webhook/telegram-webhook-id/webhook`

This is pointing to the Render deployment (`n8n-app-gvq5`) instead of your actual n8n cloud instance (`asfga.app.n8n.cloud`).

## Why This Happened
1. Your Telegram node is configured in a workflow that was created when n8n was pointing to the Render instance
2. The webhook URL got "baked in" to the node configuration
3. Even though we updated the ETF Dashboard, the existing workflow nodes still have the old URLs

## The Fix

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)
1. **Open your Telegram Trigger node** in your n8n cloud instance
2. **Look for the webhook URL field** 
3. **Change it from:** `n8n-app-gvq5/webhook/...` 
4. **Change it to:** `https://asfga.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/telegram-webhook-id/webhook`
5. **Save and test**

### Option 2: Fresh Start
1. **Delete the current Telegram Trigger node**
2. **Add a new Telegram Trigger node**
3. **It will automatically generate:** `https://asfga.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/...`
4. **Test the workflow**

## Correct URL Format
Your webhook URLs should always be:
```
https://asfga.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/your-webhook-path
```

NOT:
```
n8n-app-gvq5/webhook/your-webhook-path  ‚ùå
```

## Prevention
- Always check webhook URLs in trigger nodes match your actual n8n instance
- When copying workflows between environments, update webhook URLs
- Your n8n cloud instance URL is: `https://asfga.app.n8n.cloud/`

This should completely fix your Telegram webhook issue!
