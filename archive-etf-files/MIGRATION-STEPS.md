# ETF Integration Migration Steps

## Phase 1: Code Migration
1. **Copy ETF backend logic** into your existing server.js
2. **Add ETF frontend pages** to your public folder
3. **Integrate n8n API client** with your current setup
4. **Add database tables** for ETF functionality

## Phase 2: Route Integration
1. **Keep existing routes** for your current taskforce marketplace
2. **Add new ETF routes** for onboarding and management
3. **Create taskforce-specific onboarding flows**

## Phase 3: Client Flow Enhancement
1. **Replace "Coming Soon"** buttons with "Get Started" â†’ onboarding
2. **Map each taskforce** to corresponding n8n workflow templates
3. **Deploy personalized workflows** without client n8n access

## Implementation Plan

### Files to Add/Modify in Your Repository:
- `server.js` - Add ETF routes and n8n integration
- `public/etf-dashboard.html` - Admin interface (for you)
- `public/onboard.html` - Client onboarding flow
- `public/etf-*.js` - JavaScript for ETF functionality
- Database setup for clients/deployments

### Business Logic:
1. Client visits ergovia-ai.com/taskforce
2. Clicks "Get Started" on Dental Office taskforce
3. Redirected to dental-specific onboarding
4. Provides their clinic details and credentials
5. System creates "Dental Office - [Client Name]" workflow in your n8n
6. Client receives access info but no direct n8n access
7. Workflow runs automatically with their personalized parameters

This creates a complete white-label automation platform where clients get personalized workflows deployed to your n8n backend without technical complexity.
