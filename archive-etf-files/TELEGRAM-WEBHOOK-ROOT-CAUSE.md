# ROOT CAUSE FOUND: Telegram Webhook Issue

## The Real Problem
Based on deep research and GitHub issues, this is a **known n8n + Render specific issue**:

1. **N8N generates incorrect webhook URLs** when deployed on Render
2. **Telegram requires specific port requirements** (80, 443, 88, 8443 only)
3. **Render's internal networking** conflicts with n8n's webhook URL generation

## Evidence from Research
- GitHub Issue #12967: "Telegram Trigger Webhook Generates Incorrect URL and Fails to Work"
- Multiple Render community reports of the same issue
- Telegram requires HTTPS with specific ports and proper SSL/TLS 1.2+

## Critical Technical Requirements
Telegram webhooks require:
- **HTTPS only** (HTTP not supported)
- **Specific ports:** 80, 443, 88, 8443 ONLY
- **TLS 1.2+** (your Render instance has TLS 1.3 âœ…)
- **Proper DNS resolution** from Telegram servers

## The Issue
Your n8n instance is accessible and healthy, but when n8n tries to register the webhook with Telegram, it's either:
1. Generating an incorrect webhook URL format
2. Using an unsupported port or protocol
3. Telegram servers can't resolve the specific webhook endpoint

## Solutions to Try

### Solution 1: Manual Webhook Registration
Instead of letting n8n auto-register, manually set the webhook:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"url":"https://n8n-app-gvq5.onrender.com/webhook/<WEBHOOK_ID>/webhook"}'
```

### Solution 2: Use Different N8N Webhook URL Format
In n8n, try configuring the webhook manually with the exact format:
`https://n8n-app-gvq5.onrender.com/webhook/telegram-webhook-id/webhook`

### Solution 3: Switch to Polling (Guaranteed to Work)
Use Telegram polling instead of webhooks - completely bypasses this issue.

## Why This Happens on Render
- N8N's webhook URL generation doesn't account for Render's specific networking
- Render uses Cloudflare proxy which can interfere with webhook registration
- Some combination of n8n + Render + Telegram creates URL resolution issues

## Immediate Recommendation
Try Solution 3 (polling) first to get your automation working immediately, then troubleshoot webhooks as a secondary optimization.
